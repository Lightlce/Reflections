What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is creator. This enables us to begin making commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The Staging Area is an intermediary stage where the files are waiting to be committed.
Perhaps it is useful to make commits in one batch rather than per file.
Also, it let's you double check your work before making the commit.
Lastly, it lets you save the file in the state you want. When you edit the file again,
the changes are already saved in the state in the staging area. Only the file
from the working directory will change.
