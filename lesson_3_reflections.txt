When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When we want to collaborate with other people. Other people can work on it together remotely!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you were working on something while someone else pushed his update to github,
an automatic pull will destroy your work and then update it to that person's
update. That is not what we want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks
- a copy of a repo on GitHub itself

Clones
- a copy of a repo on GitHub to a local repo or from local to local

Branches
- a branch off of commits deviating from a master branch.
- think like alternative version

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline.
Git status, git commit and git merge all function without going online

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Using google docs

Easier
No knowledge of coding required. for general users

Harder
Merging different changes together would be near impossible, causing multiple
conflicts without notice.
