When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When we want to collaborate with other people. Other people can work on it together remotely!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you were working on something while someone else pushed his update to github,
an automatic pull will destroy your work and then update it to that person's
update. That is not what we want.
